The IT industry occupies an important place in my interests, and I try to highlight current trends and give practical advice. But my main goal is to explore the connection between technology and our inner selves, showing how it can enrich our lives.

Image processing is another area of my creativity. You can familiarize yourself with my work and find out what tools and methods I use to create unique visual solutions.

I also like to share my impressions of the books I've read. This section of the blog is dedicated to literature, which helps me find inspiration and gain a deeper understanding of the world around me.

My blog is intended for those who seek peace in the midst of information noise, strive for new knowledge and want to discover sources of inspiration. Welcome to my digital garden!
